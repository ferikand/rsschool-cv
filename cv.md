**About me:**
Prior to the outbreak of hostilities in my country, I was in charge of a distribution company for a major manufacturer of domestic electric water heaters. Now there is such a time to change the field of activity. I have been interested in web development for a long time, but there was not enough time and motivation for deep study. Now everything has changed and I do need to use the opportunity to do what I do like to do.

**Skills:**
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git, GitHub

**Code examples:**
I solve algorithmic applications in my account on the web-site [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/ferikand/completed_solutions)

example:

> The rgb function is incomplete. Complete it so that passing in RGB decimal values will result in a hexadecimal representation being returned. Valid decimal values for RGB are 0 - 255. Any values that fall out of that range must be rounded to the closest valid value.
> Note: Your answer should always be 6 characters long, the shorthand with 3 will not work here.

```
function rgb(r, g, b) {
    const hex = Array.from(arguments)
    .map(color => {
      if (color > 255) color = 255;
      if (color < 0) color = 0;
      return color.toString(16).toUpperCase();
    })
    .map(h => {
      return h.length < 2 ? (h = '0' + h) : h;
    })
    .join('');
  return hex
}

```
